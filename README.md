# Tekuno - Rust Game Exploration

This repository contains the slow incremental creation of a game in rust
starting with example code for the
[Piston](https://github.com/PistonDevelopers/piston) game library.

Through the commits, you can see me introducing new libraries and rust features
as they are needed to complete the game.

The game design and assets are based on a small game I wrote in Java as my
first Java game project early in my programming journey. That game was called
"Tekuno Yokai" and it was the most action-packed and entertaining game I've
ever written.
